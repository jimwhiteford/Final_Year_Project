<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
BUZZ is an application to help with the issue of poor beehive management and to try and increase the chance of colony survival, which will
have a positive effect on the beneficial impact bees have on the environment. There has been a shift towards a more technological solution, 
with the increased use of mobile devices and a move away from a more traditional pen and paper method. The problem being faced is that the 
applications that are currently serving this purpose are very complicated, difficult to use or very expensive. The application will incorporate
a QR code system to easily navigate between individual hives. Giving the ever-increasing number of Apiarists a management tool thatâ€™s useful 
and easy to use. 
### Built With

* Express.js
* Node.js
* Mongoose 
* Axios
* base64
